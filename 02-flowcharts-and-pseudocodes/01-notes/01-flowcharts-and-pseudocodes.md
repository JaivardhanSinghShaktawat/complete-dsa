# Flowchart & Pseudocode

## How to solve a problem ?

- Step 1 : Read and understand the problem.
- Step 2 : Read the input values.
- Step 3 : Create an approach.
- Step 4 : Implement the solution by coding.
- Step 5 : Find errors and debug it.
- Step 6 : Optimize the solution.

## How to solve a problem ?

**Problem Statement --> Solution (Flowchart/Pseudocode) --> Solution Source Code --> Machine/Binary Language.**

## What is Flowchart ?

It is diagram representation of any approach.
Here we use different diagrams to represent the solution.

## Components Of Flowcharts

1. Terminal : It is in oval shape.It is used to start and to end the flowchart.

2. Parallelogram : It is called as input and output block.It is used to take input and to output something.

3. Rectangle : It is called as processsing block.It is used for calculations.

4. Diamond : It is called as decision making block.It is used to make some decision based on some condition.

5. Arrows : It is used to connect different components together.It also shows the flow of the flowchart.

## Flowcharts Questions

1. Sum of two numbers.
2. Subtract two numbers.
3. Product of two numbers.
4. Divide two numbers.
5. Average of two numbers.
6. Square of a number.
7. Cube of a number.
8. If package is greater than equal to 10 lakhs per year than print accept else print reject.
9. If it is raining than print go outside else print don't go outside.
10. Check if a number is even or odd.
11. Check if a is greater than b.
12. Check if a number is positive or negative.
13. Print a number num , n times.
14. Print n natural numbers.
15. Sum of n natural numbers.
16. Check if a number is prime or not.

**Note :** A number is even if it is completely divisible by 2.To check it's divisibility , check its remainder.If the remainder is zero than it is divisible by 2 else not.

We can use mod or modulus operator to get the remainder when a/b.

**Loops :** Whenever we have to do the same task again and again than we use loops.

**Note :** = is called as assignment operator which is used to assign the value.
== is called as equal to operator.It is used to compare two values and it returns boolean value.

**Prime Number :** A prime number has two factors i.e 1 and the number itself.
2 is the smallest prime number.

## Pseudocodes

Here we use english and maths to represent our solution.
Pseudo means fake and code means code.

## Pseudocodes Examples

**Q1. Sum of two numbers**

1. read a and b
2. ans = a + b
3. print ans
4. exit

**Q2. Cube of a number**

1. read n
2. cube = n*n*n
3. print cube
4. exit
